# Skink

A multi-purpose bot built with [discord.js](https://discord.js.org).

- A config file contains various settings for the bot, including customising the bot's status.
- A few base commands.
- A couple of owner-only commands for managing/testing the bot.
- Prefix customisation: serverwide and per-user.
- A set of moderation commands.
- Cleverbot implementation: chat in DMs or with a command.
- A couple of extra, fun commands.
- A basic economy system to allow for future features that will make use of the currency.

#### Required Permissions

- `VIEW_CHANNEL` (Read Messages), `SEND_MESSAGES`, `EMBED_LINKS` & `ADD_REACTIONS`: for responding to commands.
- `MANAGE_ROLES`: for muting/unmuting users.
- `MANAGE_MESSAGES`: for deleting messages with the `prune` command.
- `BAN_MEMBERS`: for banning users with the `ban` command and unbanning them with the `pardon` command.
- `KICK_MEMBERS`: for banning users with the `kick` command.

#### Feature Ideas (aka TODO list)

- Rooms: when enabled by mods, users can run `room` and create a channel in a set category named after them, having complete moderation over that channel.
- Games: Hangman, Noughts & Crosses, Connect4, Battles.
- Tags (custom commands).
- Ranks/experience system. Including decay, roles based on position not just level, maybe way to "battle" other users for their xp?
- Starboard (add x starred msgs to x channel).
- Pets.

### Known Issues

- Cleverbot responds too slowly.
- Only up to 99 messages can be pruned each time.
- Custom user prefixes are global, not per-server. Is this good or bad?
